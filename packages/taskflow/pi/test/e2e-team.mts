/**
 * REAL "team" end-to-end test for the Shared Context Tree.
 *
 * A multi-role engineering team collaborates on ONE real deliverable: a
 * prioritized improvement plan for this repo's IPC subsystem
 * (`packages/taskflow-core/src/context-store.ts` +
 * `packages/pi-taskflow/src/runner.ts`). It exercises the whole
 * collaboration surface against real `pi` subagents + a real model:
 *
 *   1. scout  — surveys the subsystem ONCE, ctx_write's a shared "map"
 *               (files, key funcs, an INVARIANTS list with a per-run marker).
 *   2. 3 experts in PARALLEL — analyst (correctness/concurrency),
 *      reviewer (architecture/quality), risk-reviewer (failure/security).
 *      Each ctx_read's the scout's map FIRST (no re-deriving), audits its
 *      angle, and ctx_write's its findings back under its own key.
 *   3. lead (planner) — ctx_read's ALL expert findings, then DYNAMICALLY
 *      ctx_spawn's a deep-dive child for the single highest-risk item
 *      (vertical recursive supervision — the child's report folds back in).
 *   4. gate (critic) — quality gate: every recommendation must cite concrete
 *      evidence (file/function). VERDICT: PASS/BLOCK.
 *   5. editor (doc-writer) — synthesizes the final prioritized plan.
 *
 * Asserts the COLLABORATION actually happened (shared map reused by the experts
 * via a marker that can only come from the blackboard), the supervisor spawned
 * a deep-dive, the gate ran, and a real plan came out — verified against both
 * the run result AND the on-disk blackboard ground truth.
 *
 * Run:  node --experimental-strip-types test/e2e-team.mts   (needs real `pi`)
