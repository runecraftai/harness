/**
 * Host-neutral subagent execution contract.
 *
 * This is the seam that lets pi-taskflow's engine run on any host (pi, Codex,
 * …) without knowing how a subagent is actually spawned. The engine
 * (`runtime.ts`) only ever talks to a `SubagentRunner`; each host ships one
 * concrete implementation:
 *
 *   - pi    → `piSubagentRunner`  (spawns `pi --mode json -p …`, in runner.ts)
 *   - codex → `codexSubagentRunner` (spawns `codex exec --json …`, future)
 *
 * The data types here (`RunResult`, `RunOptions`, `LiveUpdate`) are
 * deliberately host-agnostic: they describe *what* a subagent run produces, not
 * *how* it was produced. Nothing in this file imports a host SDK.
 *
 * `runner.ts` re-exports these types so every existing
 * `import { RunResult, RunOptions, … } from "./runner.ts"` keeps working
 * unchanged — this file is purely additive.

 * fields are read structurally; everything else is accessed defensively.
