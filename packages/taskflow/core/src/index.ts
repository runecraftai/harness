 * taskflow-core — the host-neutral engine.

 * Barrel of everything the pi / codex adapters consume. The engine has no host
 * SDK dependency: schema (DSL + validation), runtime (DAG execution), cache,
 * interpolation, verification, the FlowIR compile seam, the shared context tree,
 * agent discovery, persistence, and the host-neutral SubagentRunner contract.
 *
 * Adapters inject their own subagent runner via `RuntimeDeps.runTask`.
