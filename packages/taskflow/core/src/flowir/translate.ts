/**
 * FlowIR translation — the 1:1 projection of a pi-taskflow `Taskflow` into the
 * `FlowIR` shape.
 *
 * **Stub/projection** (M1): this is a *structural* mirror, NOT a compile to
 * overstory's native inject/emits model (which expects an explicit emit
 * declaration pi-taskflow doesn't have — see roadmap §6.1). Each phase becomes
 * one `FlowIRNode`; `inject` is synthesized from `{steps.X}` interpolation refs
 * (`collectRefs`), `emits` is `[phase.id]`. The overstory-native `kind` lowering
 * is deliberately deferred.
 *
 * Pure, synchronous, never throws. Used by `compileTaskflowToIR` (./index.ts).
 *
 * @see docs/internal/overstory-convergence-roadmap.md §3 (M1)
