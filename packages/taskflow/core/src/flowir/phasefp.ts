/**
 * Per-phase structural sub-fingerprint (M6).
 *
 * `phaseFingerprint` produces a content-addressed hash of ONLY the subset of
 * the flow definition that can affect a single phase's subagent output: the
 * phase itself plus its transitive dependency closure. Folding this into the
 * cross-run cache key (instead of the whole-flow `flowDefHash`) means editing
 * phase B invalidates only B and its transitive dependents — independent
 * sibling phase A keeps its cache hit.
 *
 * ## Soundness (the fallback gate)
 *
 * Per-phase invalidation is only sound when a phase's *real* dependencies are
 * fully captured by the static `dependsOn ∪ from` closure. Three cases break
 * that guarantee, so `phaseFingerprint` returns `undefined` for them and the
 * caller falls back to the whole-flow `flowDefHash` (safe, = pre-M6 behavior):
 *
 *   1. **Shared Context Tree** (`def.contextSharing === true` or any closure
 *      member has `shareContext === true`): a sharing phase can read sibling
 *      blackboard writes OUTSIDE its declared deps, so the static closure
 *      under-approximates real reads.
 *   2. **`flow` phase in the closure** (`type === "flow"`): a `flow` phase's
 *      sub-structure is resolved at runtime (inline `def`) or from a saved
 *      flow (`use`) and is not statically visible here. Editing the saved
 *      sub-flow would not move this phase's sub-fingerprint.
 *   3. **`join: "any"` phase** (`phase.join === "any"`): validation exempts it
 *      from the `{steps.X}`-must-be-in-`dependsOn` check, so it may read
 *      phases outside its static closure. The closure under-approximates its
 *      real reads, so fall back to whole-flow invalidation.
 *
 * `cache`, `retry`, `concurrency`, and `final` are stripped from each phase
 * before hashing: none of them changes the subagent's OUTPUT (they are policy,
 * execution mechanics, or result selection). `cache`'s sub-fields
 * (`scope`/`ttl`/`fingerprint`) reach the cache key through other paths
 * (`cc.scope` gates the lookup, `cc.ttlMs` governs expiry, `cc.fingerprint` is
 * in the key tail). Every other `Phase` field is hashed. `PhaseSchema` uses
 * `additionalProperties: false`, so no surprise field can be missed.
 *
 * Pure + async (Web Crypto via `hashCanonical`). Reuses the vendored
 * `canonicalJson`/`hashCanonical` (byte-identical to overstory's contract) so
 * the sub-fingerprint shares one hashing contract with `flowDefHash`. Never
 * throws — callers wrap in try/catch and degrade to `flowDefHash`.
 *
 * @see docs/internal/cache-migration.md (v3:phasefp tier)
